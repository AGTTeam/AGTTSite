## About the game
The long lost sequel to 2007's Naruto: Path of the Ninja has finally come out of the shadows!

Experience the second half of the original story of Naruto in JRPG form in Naruto: Path of the Avenger.

## Changes to the game

**Name Changes:** Due to space limitations, some jutsu/item names had to be cut down so do not match their Path of the Ninja counterparts.

**Ninja Academy Messages:** In the original game, messages from Japanese fans could be found spread throughout the Ninja Academy. Rather than translate these directly, we used the opportunity to ask members of our Discord server to submit their own messages, which can be read by interacting with the blue scrolls hanging on the walls in various rooms.

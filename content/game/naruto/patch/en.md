If emulating the game using an older build of DeSmuME, please ensure that "Enable Advanced Bus-Level Timing" under 'Config > Emulation Settings' is turned OFF to prevent screen glitches. To avoid this issue, we recommend updating to the [latest build of DeSmuME](https://github.com/TASEmulators/desmume/releases), or switching to [MelonDS](https://melonds.kuribo64.net/downloads.php).

This hack is for the *Original Japanese ROM* and doesn't translate the game to English. If you're looking for the actual English patch, check [this page](/naruto/patch/nds) instead. If you have already applied the English translation patch, you do not need to use this hack.

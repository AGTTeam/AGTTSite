## Notes

**RetroAchievements:** A [set of RetroAchievements](https://retroachievements.org/game/15481) for the game has been created by team member LaytonLoztew. For a list of compatible emulators, please visit [RetroAchievements.org](https://retroachievements.org/download.php
). 

**Unlock All Characters:** Some characters in the game require Wireless Communications (local play using two DS consoles) to unlock. One workaround is to use the "Unlock all characters" cheat code provided in the translated cheat files. Due to the potential for bugs/crashes, we do not advise using it before clearing the game.

For those who want to unlock all characters manually/without cheats, a second workaround has been created:

- **Obtain Kakashi & Jiraiya:** Talk to Anko at the Main Arena. She will give you Kakashi and Jiraiya's Ninja Tags, which can be used from the inventory once the game has been cleared.

- **Obtain Ino & Hinata:** To obtain these characters, you need to acquire the *Ninja Flower: Valeriana* from a chest in the Land of Fire Border. Then, give the flower to either Ino OR Hinata at the Leaf Village in exchange for their Ninja Tag. Use the Tag to recruit the character, then talk to Konohamaru on the rooftop of the Ninja Academy. He will provide you with another flower which can be used to recruit the second character. (If you have not yet obtained the flower/used the first Ninja Tag, you will not receive anything.)

- **Obtain Shino & Tenten**: To obtain these characters, you need to acquire the *Secret Ninjutsu Catalog* from a chest in Orochimaru's Hideout. Then, follow the steps above, substituting the Flower for the Catalog, and Ino/Hinata for Shino/Tenten.

A ROM hack allowing this workaround to be used without changing the language of the game is also available [here](https://agtteam.net/naruto/patch/ndsjp).

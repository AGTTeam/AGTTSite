## Changes to the game
In the original game, only Japanese characters can be used in the name-entry screens, whereas in the patched game, only English characters may be used. Save files are however fully compatible between the two. If transferring a save file from the original to the patched game, any unnamed mushi, and any numbers, will be translated (e.g. "名称不明〇〇一" will become "Mushi 001"), but any custom names will be preserved.

## About the game

Based on the Mushishi anime/manga series, the game follows a young Mushishi apprentice as they go about their daily life in a rural village. Explore a lush hand-drawn environment as you fish, gather herbs, befriend the villagers, and most importantly, catch and document the strange, ethereal creatures known as "mushi" which share your home.

## About the game
Soul Eater: Battle Resonance is a traditional 2.5D fighting game that follows the story of the fan-favorite anime series. Released simultaneously for the PS2 and PSP, it features 11 unique stages and 13 characters to choose from, many of which are playable for the very first time.

The PS2 version contains the Soul Theater, an additional mode for viewing screenshots from the anime, as well as additional costumes for Maka, Blackâ˜†Star and Kid. The PSP version supports Ad Hoc multiplayer to play with friends over two devices, allowing both players to have their own dedicated camera.

## Notes
**Button Swaps:**
The game originally followed the Japanese control scheme, wherein O = select and X = back. These have been swapped in the patch.

**Font:**
The game originally relied on the PSP bios font, which meant it could look very different on hardware vs an emulator. We embedded a new font into the game to remove this issue.

**Versus Mode:**
The game contains an ad hoc mode allowing two local players to go head-to-head. To the best of our knowledge, this has been fully translated, but we were unable to test it so there may be some errors.

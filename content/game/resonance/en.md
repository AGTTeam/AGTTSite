## About the game
Soul Eater: Battle Resonance is a traditional 2.5D fighting game that follows the story of the fan-favorite anime series. Released simultaneously for the PS2 and PSP, it features 11 unique stages and 13 characters to choose from, many of which are playable for the very first time.

The PS2 version contains the Soul Theater, an additional mode for viewing screenshots from the anime, as well as additional costumes for Maka, Blackâ˜†Star and Kid. The PSP version supports Ad Hoc multiplayer to play with friends over two devices, allowing both players to have their own dedicated camera.

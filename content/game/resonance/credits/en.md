## Notes
**Button Swaps:**
The game originally followed the Japanese control scheme, wherein O = select and X = back. These have been swapped in the patch.

**Font:**
The PSP version originally relied on the PSP bios font, which meant it could look very different on hardware vs. an emulator. We embedded a new font into the game to remove this issue.

**Versus Mode:**
The PSP version of the game contains an ad hoc mode allowing two local players to go head-to-head. To the best of our knowledge, this has been fully translated, but we were unable to test it so there may be some errors.

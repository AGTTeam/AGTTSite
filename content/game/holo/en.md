## About the game
A business-dating sim based on the hit light novel/anime series of the same name. Set in an alternative universe, the story follows the player, a novice merchant, who signs a contract with wolf-deity Holo promising to deliver her to her hometown within the space of the year. There’s just one catch - it’s been several centuries since Holo was last there.

Track down information about the rumored “Ancient Forest” while moving between town to town, trading in local specialties and avoiding the eye of the Church.

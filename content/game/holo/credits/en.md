## Changes to the game

* Added subtitles to the opening movie & special message
* Adjusted line spacing for white speech bubble messages (rumors, tips, etc.), to allow for six lines to be used instead of five.
* Fixed a mistake during the “Confectionary Contest” consultation in which the Grocer's nametag is shown for two of Holo's lines.

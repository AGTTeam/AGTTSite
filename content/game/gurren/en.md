## About the game
Based on the hit anime series of the same name, the game retells the story of Simon, a fourteen-year-old boy, who discovers an ancient mecha hidden deep in the recesses of the underground vault that is his hometown.

Full of action-packed battles, mini-games, 3 exclusive characters and an alternative ending, follow Gurren Lagann on a journey that will change the fate of the universe.

## Translation Notes for New Content
The game features some exclusive content for which there is no official translation. Some names that may have previously been known to fans through the Nyoro~n Subs translation of the OVA (Ep 5.5), characters 'Chitori' and 'Jigitalis', as well as the Gunmen 'Daorek' and 'Usaggon', have been changed to 'Tetori', 'Ziggitalis', 'Zaolegg' and 'Usappyon' respectively, following abbreviations found in the game files. (It should be noted that these too are approximations, as the game files are by no means consistent.)

The joke lost in translation; "usa-pyon" is a portmanteau of the words *usagi* (rabbit) and *pyon* (onomatopoeia for a hopping noise), and sounds very similar to the (somewhat outdated) slang word "uso-pyon", meaning "just kidding!", hence why Kamina names the Gunman "Usappyon" upon seeing its rabbit-like appearance.

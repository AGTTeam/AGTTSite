## Changes to the game
A compiled list of bug fixes/tweaks that were made to the original ROM.

* Added a cheat code to unlock the hidden debug menu when starting a new game from an empty slot
* Extended text boxes and moved the message icon to allow for more space
* Edited Simon's sprite to remove his armband pre-leaving Littner (when Kamina first puts on his father's cloak and Simon catches a piece of it)
* Added new sprite animations for Dayakka, Rossiu, Old Coco, The Black Siblings, Viral, Gimmy and Darry 
* Re-added a hidden conversation with Dayakka in Chapter 04 (Gurren Emerges!!) Note: it displays with the "!?" normally reserved for battles, and doesn't change after speaking with him
* Edited the spacing of the battle result text ("Victory", "Defeat" & "Draw") to be closer together to read better in English
* Swapped the names of skills 077 "Combustion Reaching To Heaven" & 078 "Combustion Of Bro's Thoughts" (stamp minigames) around to fit better with their quotes
* Fixed an issue with cut-in images flashing up, then disappearing in Chapter 17 (What The Hell Is "Civilisation"!?)

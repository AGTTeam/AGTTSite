When emulating the game, you may experience some visual errors (lines, spots on models etc) if postprocessing shaders are applied, or if the internal rendering resolution or texture scaling is set too high. Some movies may also have grey box(es) near the beginning, which canâ€™t be fixed by changing the settings.
<br /><br />
Both of these issues are present in the unpatched game and do not happen on real hardware.

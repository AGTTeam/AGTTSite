## Notes
**Slow Text Load:**
The text may sometimes take a while to render for the first time, leading to empty menus/missing choices. This is an issue present in the original game, and is more apparent on hardware.

**Save Game Text:**
Any saves made in the unpatched version of the game will still show the save information in Japanese until overwritten. 

**Communication Mode:**
The game contains an ad hoc mode allowing two local players to go head-to-head. To the best of our knowledge, this has been fully translated, but we were unable to test it so there may be some errors. 

**Battle UI Display:**
It is not explained in the game controls, but pressing the up/down buttons on the D-Pad toggles the display for the battle gauges and subtitles respectively.

**Reminiscence/Delusion Subtitles:**
Despite our best efforts, we were unable to find a way to successfully add subtitles to the Reminiscence and Delusion modes. Unless someone else is able to make a breakthrough, this will not be updated in future versions.

## About the game
Based on the hit light novel/anime series of the same name, Bakemonogatari Portable is a game so true to its unique source material, the developers had to invent a new genre. In this “crazy mad delusional drama”, words become weapons in fast-paced dialogue battles.

The story mode follows the ordeals of Koyomi Araragi, a high school boy turned vampire and back again. Trouble soon gets a taste for him, as he encounters a cast of quirky characters with mysterious disorders that blur the lines between the supernatural and psychological.

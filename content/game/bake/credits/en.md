## Changes to the game
**Button Swaps:**
The game originally followed the Japanese control scheme, wherein O = select and X = back. These have been swapped in the patch.

**Vertical Text:**
All instances of vertical text in the game were replaced with rotated text, to allow for more characters to be used.

**Subtitle Centering:**
The in-battle subtitles were changed from being left aligned to centered, to be consistent with the movies (which are centered in the original version as well.) 

**Alphabetical Sorting:**
Filtering lines in alphabetical order originally sorted them into Japanese "aiueo" order. This was changed to follow Latin alphabetical order.

**Install Data:**
The install data was designed to speed up load times for those playing the game using a UMD, by installing data from the UMD to the Memory Card.
While it can still be installed, the patched game will ignore the install data, and the prompt to install it when starting a new game has also been removed.

This was done because editing the install data to make it function with the patch would make it incompatible with the original game, and that install data serves no purpose to those playing the game with an emulator/the majority of people playing on hardware.

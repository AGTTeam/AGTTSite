## Changes to the game
**Button Swaps:**
The game originally followed the Japanese control scheme, wherein O = select and X = back. These have been swapped in the patch.

**Vertical Text:**
All instances of vertical text in the game were replaced with rotated text to allow for more characters to be used.

**Subtitle Centering:**
The in-battle subtitles were changed from being left aligned to centered, to be consistent with the movies (which are centered in the original version as well.) 

**Alphabetical Sorting:**
Filtering lines in alphabetical order originally sorted them into Japanese "aiueo" order. This was changed to follow Latin alphabetical order.

**Install Data:**
The install data was designed to speed up load times for those playing the game using a UMD. While it can still be installed, it is not functional in the patched version.

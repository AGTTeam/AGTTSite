## About the game
A business-dating sim based on the hit light novel/anime series of the same name. The second NDS game for the series, it expands upon many of the mechanics from the first, while still boasting an original story which is understandable without having played [My Year With Holo](/holo).

On their journey north to find Holo’s long-lost birthplace, merchant Kraft Lawrence and his beautiful companion hit a roadblock; the Church have imposed strict travel restrictions in the area. To make matters worse, having taken on a contract to collect a debt from across the sea, Lawrence faces heavy repercussions if he fails to make it there in time.

With so much at stake, this may be one business venture too big for the pair to face alone…

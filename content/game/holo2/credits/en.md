## Notes
**Subtitles**
You may notice a full or partial black line flash up for a second when subtitles begin playing. Subtitles are used for the opening movie, end credits and special messages. This is merely a visual error and should not cause any playback issues.

**Bug Fix**
The patch contains a fix for a rare bug present in the original game which prevented the contract to deliver 1 Milk, 1 Egg and 2 Mussels to Dielmon from being completed.

**Rumor Extension**
The line spacing of the large white speech bubbles (rumors, hints, etc.), was adjusted to allow for six lines to be used instead of five. This is consistent with what was done for the first game, My Year with Holo.

**BG Change**
The background images used in Norah’s “Shoulder Massage” event have been changed from a day street scene to an inn at night to better fit the mood.

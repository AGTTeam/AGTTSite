## About the game
With the world order under threat from the plight of the Kishin, three teams work to hone their skills at the at the famous “Death Weapon Meister Academy”. Maka, Black☆Star and Kid are on a mission to gather enough souls to turn their partners into Death Scythes - weapons worthy of being wielded by Lord Death himself. Facing off against Witches, Zombies and Immortals, they must learn to overcome their own weaknesses, lest they become consumed by madness.

Based on the series of the same name, the game follows along the first half of the anime.

## About the game
Soul Eater: Monotone Princess is an action game based on the hit manga/anime series of the same name, boasting an original story, new characters, and animated cutscenes by Studio Bones made specifically for the game.

Large groups of people have begun disappearing around the world, and it is up to the DWMA’s one-star meisters to keep the peace and discover the villain pulling the strings behind this nefarious scheme.

Take control of Maka Albarn, Black☆Star, and Death the Kid, each with their own unique side missions, and see an all new side of the Soul Eater universe.

## Known Issues
While the patch has been extensively tested and has no known gameplay bugs, there are some minor issues retained from the original version of the game.

**Tile Edges:**  
When emulating the game, image tiles sometimes seem to be rendered 1px off, leaving small gaps in the character sprites. This occurs even with 1x Internal Resolution and Anisotropic Filtering / Anti-aliasing off. This is due to various texture interpolation issues on Dolphin and does not happen on real hardware.

**Font Issues:**  
The black stroke surrounding the text is sometimes cut off. This happens with the original game and on real hardware, but is more noticeable in the patch due to the sharpness of English letters. It should not affect the legibility of the text.

**Credits Movie Frame Stutter:**  
When emulating the game, the credits movie stutters towards the end as Lord Death appears. This does not happen on real hardware.

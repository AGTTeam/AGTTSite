## Notes
**Name Flip:**
In Japanese, a person's name is generally written with their family name first, followed by their given name (e.g., Doe John). This has been flipped in the patch, and the player's name should be input in English name order (e.g., John Doe).

If you have previously created a save using a Japanese name, it will still be compatible, however the order will be flipped.

**L Communicator Demo:**
In the "Extras" menu, it is possible to send a trial version of the L Communicator to another DS via Wireless Communication. This has been fully translated, but due to the DS' security protection, can only be played on compatible emulators or a [flashed DS](https://wiki.gbatemp.net/wiki/FlashMe).

## About the game
L - the ProLogue to Death Note: Spiraling Trap is the last of three Nintendo DS games based on the Death Note license.

An escape game, it sees players take on the role of a rookie FBI agent who awakens to find themselves imprisoned in an unknown location. With the world’s greatest detective, L, only able to provide assistance via a PDA, it’s up to the player to solve the many traps in their way and uncover the truth behind the mysterious plot.

## Known Issues
These issues are inherited from the original game:
* The step objective images for three late-stage small traps are incorrect.
* During the end credits, the text may appear to flicker (on hardware), and/or black bars may temporarily appear (on emulator).

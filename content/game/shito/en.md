## About the game
Based on the highly influential anime series, Neon Genesis Evangelion, the game stars Ryoji Kaji who is tasked with raising an angel into its final form.

In the game you can raise up your angel like a digital pet and explore NERV headquarters. Talk to characters from the series such as Shinji, Asuka, Misato, and Rei; and view special events based on the anime as well as new original scenarios.

Once youâ€™ve helped your angel reach maturity and leveled up its stats, you can battle it against other angels from the main menu. Battles play out like a card game and can be played in both single-player and multiplayer modes.

With 20+ angels to raise, tons of Tokyo-3 to explore, and multiple endings; Shito Ikusei is a new way to experience the world of Evangelion.

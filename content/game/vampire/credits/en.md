## Notes
**Player Name:**
In the original game, players were able to enter a custom name (default: 黒主 優姫 Cross Yuki) that would then be used throughout the game whenever a character addressed the protagonist. This name had a limit of 3x3 characters, which we were unable to extend. After much consideration, we decided to remove the custom name feature, and hardcode all entries as ‘Yuki Cross’.

The name entry screen is still visible in the patch, where it serves the purpose of save game identification only.

**Space Limitations:**
Due to technical limitations, we had to limit the character count in the minigame menu descriptions and the item shop. This undoubtedly led to some awkward translations and a loss of the original flavor, but we don’t believe these should affect the overall enjoyment of the game.

## About the game
At the prestigious Cross Academy exists a special group of students known as the Night Class, who hold a dark secret.

Based on the hit anime/manga series of the same name, the game features an original story which places players in the shoes of Yuki Cross, guardian of the school. Along with her usual duties of patrolling with Zero and keeping the Day Class under control, Yuki can also accompany the Night Class on various events, and discover a whole new side to many fan-favorite characters.

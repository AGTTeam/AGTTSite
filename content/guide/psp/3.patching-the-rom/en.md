Once you've dumped your UMD to an `.iso` file, patching it with the English Translation can be done easily through the :guide-link{url="/patch/psp" text="ROM Patcher"} tool we provide, or by manually downloading the patch `.xdelta` file and using patching software, such as [XDeltaUI](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/598/?device=emu) to patch your ROM file.

## Online patcher

Please make sure you've carefully followed the instructions to dump your ROM.
::
1. Navigate to the :guide-link{url="/patch/psp" text="Rom Patcher"} page on this site.
2. Drag and drop your dumped .iso ROM file into the "Select ROM" box.
3. Check that the latest version of the patch is selected from the dropdown.
4. Click "Apply Patch" and your game will be automatically patched with the latest version. Save the patched ROM somewhere easily accessible. Be careful not to overwrite your original ROM, in case you need it later or if we update the patch.
5. You can now proceed to [playing the game](playing-the-game).

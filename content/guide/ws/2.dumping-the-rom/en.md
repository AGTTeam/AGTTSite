Unlike the Game Boy, there are very few flashers/dumpers for the WonderSwan. As the ones which are available are very elusive/expensive, most guides are designed to walk you through building your own.

* [GameBank](https://www.gamebank-web.com/) used to make a WS adapter for their retro dumper, but it has since been discontinued and removed from their page.
* [Sanni's Cartreader](https://github.com/sanni/cartreader) can dump WS cartridges using a custom adapter. It requires salvaging a cart reader slot from a WonderSwan console (the [Save the Hero](https://savethehero.builders/) version of the Sanni dumper has an adapter for the WonderSwan).
* A [manual dumping guide](http://pasofami.game.coocan.jp/wsc/ws-wiring.htm) exists, but it is an advanced project.

## Before you proceed
You should now have dumped your game to a `.ws` ROM file that you can patch. Move this to somewhere easily accessible.

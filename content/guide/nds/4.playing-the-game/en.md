### Emulate on Windows, macOS, or Linux
There are a few options for PC DS emulators, but the one we recommend is melonDS for its emulation accuracy and performance.

#### melonDS setup
**Requirements:**
* Windows, macOS or Linux computer

**Setup:**

Simply [download melonDS](https://melonds.kuribo64.net/downloads.php) (**v0.9.4+**) from the project website for your platform (Windows, macOS, Linux) and save it somewhere easily accessible to your computer.

**Playing the game:**

With melonDS setup, all you need to do in order to play the game is select "File"  "Open ROM" in the top menu bar and choose the ROM file you patched earlier.

melonDS has a number of advanced features, such as configuring controllers and tweaking display settings. You can check out the [melonDS Website](https://melonds.kuribo64.net/) for more information.

#### Other PC emulators
* [DeSmuME](https://desmume.org/)－Another popular PC emulator, but may have performance issues with certain games.
* [No$GBA](https://www.nogba.com/)－Not recommended due to severe general emulation accuracy issues. It's also infrequently updated and not very user-friendly.

<div class="platform-filtered platform-wii_u_virtual_console">

### Emulate on Wii U by injecting the Virtual Console
If you own a Wii U console, Nintendo's official Virtual Console DS emulator provides accurate emulation, complemented nicely by the Wii U Gamepad, which works great with the touchscreen used frequently in this game.

To do this, you'll need to homebrew your Wii U, use UWUVCI to convert the ROM into a WUP (Wii U title) and then install it to your system using WUP Installer GX2.

**Requirements:**
* Wii U system with internet access
* SD card with at least 4GB capacity
* Windows PC to run UWUVCI

#### Part 1 - Homebrew your Wii U
1. Follow the steps [on this guide](https://wiiu.hacks.guide/) to install a CFW (Custom Firmware) Wrapper, Tiramisu, onto your system from your SD card via an exploit in the Internet Browser.
2. Continue [following the steps](https://wiiu.hacks.guide/#/tiramisu/finalizing-setup?id=additional-homebrew-apps) to install the Homebrew App Store to your system.
3. Boot into the Homebrew App Store through Tiramisu by launching into Tiramisu on the Health & Safety screen of your console when powering it on.
4. On the Homebrew App Store, navigate to or search for WUP Installer GX2 (it should be near the top). Download and install it to your system, following the on-screen instructions.
5. Once successfully installed, power off your Wii U system and remove the SD card. Re-insert it into your computer.

#### Part 2 - Make ROM into WUP with UWUVCI
1. Ensure your SD Card is back inserted into your computer
2. On your PC, download and install the latest release of [UWUVCI](https://github.com/stuff-by-3-random-dudes/UWUVCI-AIO-WPF/releases/). If you are prompted by Microsoft Defender/Windows StartScreen, click "More Details" and "Run Anyway". The program may take some time to download tools and data.
3. When the program loads up, select the DS icon on the left-hand side of the screen.
4. Select the following options:
    - On the "Base ROM" dropdown, choose "Mario Kart DS (US)" or "Mario Kart DS (EU)" (depending on your region; if you aren't in the US or EU, just pick either one, it doesn't really matter)
    - Click the "Enter CKey" button. Click "Read from otp.bin" and select the otp.bin file on your SD card that you created earlier when installing the Custom Firmware as part of the NAND Dump process. If you don't have this for whatever reason, you'll need to find the Wii U common key and write it in manually instead.
    - Click on the "Enter TKey" button. You will now need to insert the title key for Mario Kart DS for the region you selected. There's no easy way of getting this other than by looking it up online. Make sure you enter the key for the Mario Kart DS region you selected.
    - Click "Choose File" next to "ROM PATH" and choose the patched *:guide-data* ROM file
    - On the "Icon Image" box, click "Create File". Download *:guide-data{data="vc-image"}* (or use your own) and choose it under "Select File". Feel free to customize the appearance, this is the icon that will appear on your Wii U system menu. Then, click "Finish"
    - On the "TV Image" box, click "Create File", enter the name of the game on the two lines (*:guide-data{data="split-title"}*), the release year (*:guide-data{data="year"}*) and the number of players (1). Then select the same file for the icon image (or choose your own!). Then, click "Finish".
    - Enter in the "Game Name" box: *:guide-data{data="split-line1"}*\|*:guide-data{data="split-line2"}*
    - You can also optionally choose some other pieces of art that will appear on your Wii U menu when launching the game, such as a splash image and boot sound.
5. When you're done, click "Inject". Your ROM will be injected into a Wii U WUP title.
6. Once done, click "WUP Installable". Wait for it to pack the WUP into the format, then click "Copy to SD". Your WUP file will be copied to the correct directory on your Wii U, so you can add it to your system using WUP Installer GX2.
7. Remove your SD card from your computer and put it back into your Wii U.

#### Part 3 - Install WUP with WUP Installer GX2
1. Power on your Wii U with the SD card re-inserted.
2. Launch WUP Installer GX2 you previously installed through Tiramisu
3. Select the WUP title you created and proceed through WUP Installer GX's on-screen instructions to install the title to your system menu. You can also optionally install WUP Installer GX to your Wii U menu here, too.
4. When the installation has completed, you can launch the game from your system menu.

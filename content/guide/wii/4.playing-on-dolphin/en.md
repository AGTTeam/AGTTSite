The recommended emulator for Wii games is [Dolphin](https://dolphin-emu.org/), which is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Dolphin is also available for Android, however at the time of writing, most mobile devices are not powerful enough to support playing Wii games smoothly, so we do not recommend it.

## Playing on Dolphin

**Installing Dolphin:**

Installing Dolphin on Windows PC or Mac is pretty straightforward. Simply download the latest release or nightly build from the [Download page](https://dolphin-emu.org/download/) and extract it into a new folder.

Linux users should follow the guide on the [Dolphin Emulator Wiki](https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Installing_Dolphin#Linux) to install for your distros.

**Configuring Controllers:**
Once Dolphin is installed, it's time to configure your controllers!

To use a real Wii Remote, you will need a PC that supports Bluetooth. For the sensor bar, you can purchase a USB or Wireless Sensor Bar which connects to your computer. Or, you can use the Wii's sensor bar by connecting it to your Wii and turning the Wii on so there's power to the bar. (Just make sure that your Wii Remote is connected to Dolphin, and not the Wii.)

Alternatively, you can emulate the Wii Remote using a keyboard and mouse, or gamepad controller.

To setup your real or emulated Wii Remote, follow [these steps](https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Configuring_Controllers#Wii_Remote).

Various bits and pieces that were left behind which give us a window into the development process!

Not pictured; massive inconsistencies in naming convention for both Japanese and Romanized names e.g. ゲンバー (Genbā) & ゲンヴァー (Genvā) for Gember, and ‘ZIGG’ & ‘JIGI’ prefixes for files belonging to ジギタリス (Jigitarisu), a new character introduced in game. (I’ve gone for the spelling ‘Ziggitalis’.)

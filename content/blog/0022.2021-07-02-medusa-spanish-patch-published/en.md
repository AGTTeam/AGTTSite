Remember when we said we had some news about a project to translate one of our past works into another language? Well, we’re very pleased to announce that Max1323 has released their [patch of Medusa’s Plot in Spanish](https://www.romhacking.net/translations/6149/)!

The patch is fully playable, and even translates the images. And if you’re interested in more Spanish fan-translations, be sure to check out Max’s impressive catalogue on their website, [here](https://traduccionesmax1323.blogspot.com)!

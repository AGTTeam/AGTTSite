It’s been a quiet two months down at the AGT Team, but a busy one in real life!

## [NDS] Vampire Knight DS

Excitingly, the translation has now reached Chapter 7, which is the final chapter (minus the endings). We’ve also been working on the flavor text, as you can see above.

Space limitations in the game mean that some of these are being cut off, and we still have the challenge of figuring out what to do with the player name input which is currently a pitiful 6 characters long, but our determination is as everlasting as a resin rose!


## [NDS] Death Note: Kira Game

As for Death Note: Kira Game, the translation has progressed up through chapter 8 of the story mode. At this point in the game, the Yotsuba group has been introduced, although the game only includes three characters from said group, namely Namikawa, Higuchi, and Ooi.

One interesting thing to note is that the thief, Wedy, and the con-man, Aiber, are nowhere to be seen in this game despite Sayu Yagami even being made a playable character.  


## [Wii] Soul Eater: Monotone Princess

Monotone Princess has seen its fair share of setbacks, but we’re working hard to make one final push to completion! Thanks to the graphics team, we now have an English logo, complete with a custom-made font, but as you can see there’s still more to do on that front. If you did happen to have some time to spare to help with graphics or playtesting, it’s not [too late to apply](https://discord.com/invite/UUF7Zbm)!


## Other projects

Of course, we haven’t forgotten about our other works either! There’s no news to report for Battle Resonance this time, but it is far from abandoned. We’ve also made as much progress as is possible on the technical side of Spice & Wolf, which has now been moved to our ‘upcoming projects’ list, whilst we await more translators.

We’re also excited to have been helping on a project to translate one of our past works into another language, and hope to be able to bring you more news on that in the near future.

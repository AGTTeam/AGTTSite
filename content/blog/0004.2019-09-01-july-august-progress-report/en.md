Whew! It feels like two months have just flown by. This month, we’re starting with a new project…

## \[NDS\] Ore ga Omae wo Mamoru (Non-Anime)

A step away from my usual haunts, this is another game not based on an anime. Described as an “Metroidvania for girls”, it’s a dungeon-crawling otome game.  Make of that what you will(!)

A patch covering the ‘essentials’ was reportedly scheduled for release by [Jei](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fgbatemp.net%2Fthreads%2Fore-ga-omae-wo-mamoru.159429%2F&t=ZjNmZmUyNDAzNDlmNTIxNWNkNGZjYWVlZjAyNTM4NDMyZWMzZjMwMSxlM2ZiZDdkNDdmNTY2ZTllZjg4ODZmMDNlZmZjYWQyMDU1ZDhhNTg4), but having been unable to get in contact with them, I’ve restarted translations from scratch.


## \[NDS\] Chou Soujuu Mecha MG (Non-Anime)

Continuing with non-anime games, I’m delighted to say that after 5 months of hiatus, work has begun on this project once again! Supper is bearing the brunt of proofreading, with 120 missions and a likely vast amount of typos to go through.


## \[NDS\] Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann

Illidan has been working tirelessly, creating new and updated scripts to get this patch into motion! There’s still a fair bit that I need to finish and touch up, but as it stands, this is likely to be the next release.


## Other Works

Death Note: Kira Game is still on the horizon, with Ryusui taking the lead. 

I decided to withdraw from the Vampire Knight translation, due to taking issue with how it was being managed. The project is now under new management, but still in early days. My priority is to get the most complete patches out first, with progress likely to slow down come the start of the academic year. I do hope to return to it at some point, though!

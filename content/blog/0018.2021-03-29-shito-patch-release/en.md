## Neon Genesis Evangelion: Angel Raising Project (新世紀エヴァンゲリオン シト育成) patch by the Anime Game Translations Team

Based on the highly influential anime series, Neon Genesis Evangelion, the game stars Ryoji Kaji who is tasked with raising an angel into its final form.  

Raise up your angel like a digital pet and explore NERV headquarters. Talk to characters from the series such as Shinji, Asuka, Misato, and Rei; and view special events based on the anime as well as new original scenarios.

Once you’ve helped your angel reach maturity and leveled up its stats, you can battle it against other angels from the main menu. Battles play out like a card game and can be played in both single-player and multiplayer modes.

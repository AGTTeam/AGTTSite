## \[NDS\] Naruto RPG 2: Chidori Vs Rasengan

Hey all! Ligudink here! The localized title for the patch has been decided! It will be “Naruto: Path of the Avenger” as was voted on the Discord Server of AGT. The reason behind this name is symbolic. Naruto follows the path of the ninja while Sasuke follows the path of the avenger. Since this game is heavily focused on the Sasuke Retrieval Arc and seeing that it’s the true sequel for the first Path of the Ninja game thus covering the canon story, we’ve decided to treat this localized product as the second half of POTN1.

POTN2 still follows the tale of Naruto Uzumaki and he walks it alone, and therefore the naming convention will still make sense and not create a confusion behind having two games that have the “POTN2” label.

The game is in the final stages of proofreading to be done by yours truly, so get ready to finally experience the end of the Naruto RPG trilogy!!


## \[NDS\] Mushishi: Amefuru Sato

## Other Projects

Those of you who are in our [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/UUF7Zbm) or keep a close eye on our [project list](https://agtteam.tumblr.com/projects) may have noticed we’ve added two new projects; Death Note: Successors to L for NDS and Fullmetal Alchemist 3: The Girl Who Succeeds God for PS2!

Both are still in the early stages having only started recently, but we look forward to bringing you more information about them next time!

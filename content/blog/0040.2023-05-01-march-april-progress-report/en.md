Real life has hit our progress hard lately, but we remain as committed as ever to getting these translations out for all to enjoy!

## \[NDS\] Mushishi: Amefuru Sato

Hi! Ithyrial here! I’m one of the translators working on the localization of Mushishi: Amefuru Sato.

For those of you who are not familiar with Mushishi, all you really need to know is that the series focuses on ethereal creatures called “mushi”. While mushi are usually harmless, some can be dangerous, and that’s where the need for “Mushishi” (or “Mushi Masters” in the English dub of the anime) arises; their job is to study mushi and help people who have been affected by them.

Mushishi: Amefuru Sato (roughly translates to “the village that fell from heaven”) follows a young Mushishi apprentice as they go about their everyday life in a small village. Gameplay consists of exploring the village, interacting with other characters, and collecting mushi.

I’m sorry to reveal that there hasn’t been much progress since the last update. As of writing, only the introductory sequence and some UI elements have been translated, so there’s still a lot of work to be done, but I’m hoping to pick up the pace so we can get this bad boy out as soon as possible! If anyone is interested in helping, please feel free to [contact the team](https://discord.com/invite/UUF7Zbm)!  


## \[NDS\] Naruto RPG 2: Chidori Vs Rasengan

Since our last update, we’ve made several more tweaks to the Naruto RPG2 tool to fix some bugs and improve the performance of the patch. We’re still not quite there on the technical side, but you can see the massive improvement in this screenshot compared to some of our older ones - the text for the alternative team members and summons is now working, and Money/Ryo on the top right is looking a lot better.

We’ve also implemented the ability to edit map tiles as seen on the left. Some of these will be ported from POTN1 & 2, but we’re also working on making new versions for things that weren’t translated/didn’t look great in the original. In short, there’s still a way to go, but we’re getting closer!


## \[NDS\] L - the ProLogue to Death Note: Spiraling Trap

![L - the ProLogue to Death Note: Spiraling Trap screenshot](/images/blog/0040/716135016436039680_2.png)

Proofreading is continuing slow but steady on L - the ProLogue to Death Note. We’ve had a few new proofreaders join the team, and with everyone’s different setups we’ve been able to spot and squash some bugs which were only affecting certain hardware/emulators. There’s only a few known bugs left now, one of which originates from the original game that we’re hoping to get to the bottom of.

We’ve also been working on plenty more things behind the scenes. Pictured is our new tool interface which we’re in the middle of rolling out to all of our compatible projects. Gone is the pesky command line and confusing setup instructions! In with a streamlined UI that’s compatible with Windows, Mac and Linux! This particular screenshot is from the NendoTranslation tool for Nendoroid Generation on PSP, which is one of [several upcoming projects](https://agtteam.tumblr.com/projects) that we’re looking for translators for!

Lastly, the [Soul Eater: Monotone Princess patch](/monopri) has been updated to version 1.1 to improve the compatibility of the patcher and make the instructions clearer. If you’ve had trouble patching it in the past, this should hopefully solve your issue! (The translation itself has not been changed.)

\*Dusts away the cobwebs\* We hope everyone had a fun Halloween that was as spooky or unspooky as you like. Here’s what we’ve been up to lately!

## [NDS] Naruto RPG 2: Chidori Vs Rasengan

Ligudink here! I would like to apologize for the lackluster update I have on this translation. Translation is up to the iconic fight between Itachi and Kakashi. Also a few bugs were discovered and are currently being worked on.

I hope to bring more updates to you all by the end of this year, hopefully I would not be as busy as I am now with my senior year in college. Take care!  


## [NDS] L - the ProLogue to Death Note: Spiraling Trap

The majority of L - the ProLogue to Death Note’s text has now been translated, and most of the image work has been done too. We’re currently on the trail of a few bugs which are making the gameplay more guess work than it should be, but once they’re squashed we’ll be all ready for proofreading!


## Other Projects

There’s no updates for Kimi no Yusha this time around, but we do have news about one of our past projects which should be receiving a Spanish translation coming soon :D

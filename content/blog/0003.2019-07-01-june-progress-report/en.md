I’m afraid that I have been going ghost on tumblr, more so than is acceptable even for a _phantom_. So from now on, I’ll try to post bi-monthly updates on projects! (Long post incoming.)


## \[NDS\] Chou Soujuu Mecha MG (Non-Anime)

If you are a fan of Super Smash Bros. you may recognise the name from Brawl!

A [partial translation patch](https://gbatemp.net/threads/chou-soujuu-mecha-mg-essentials-translation.488234/) covering the ‘essential’ text was released by Supper in 2017, which has been the foundation for this project. 

I must admit that I am not normally the first to jump at the ‘mecha’ genre, but this game swept me in with it’s charm and fun gameplay. It’s often quoted as an example of the best use of the DS touch screen controls, and it’s easy to see why.

The translation is now at 100%, although proofreading is on hold for the moment.


## \[NDS\] Death Note: Kira Game

To the anon who asked about this game before, it turns out that the video of the Spanish project, was created using tools by @theryusui who was working on a translation patch over a decade ago! 

That is a long time by anyone’s standards, so they have been digging through old folders to see what might be found.


## \[NDS\] Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann

I’ve been working on this project solo for now, thanks to a text dump from [Illidan](https://gbatemp.net/threads/decoding-tengen-toppa-gurren-lagann-images.354139/). 

The game mostly follows the anime, with an alternative ending and three new characters who I am very excited about.

There is rather a large number of images to contend with, but the translation currently stands at around 75%! I am hoping to find a translation checker and hacker to help out with it soon.


## \[NDS\] Vampire Knight DS

This game has been proving a bit of a challenge, both on the hacking and translation front, however we are coming up to being able to recruit more translators, so interested parties, please keep an eye out!

Being an otome game, it is the most text heavy project I have attempted to date. Although, set in an AU with a unique incite into some of the more ‘minor’ characters, I think it’s a challenge well worth taking on.

Chapters 1 and 2 have been fully translated, with chapter 3 on hold whilst I try to think of the best way to approach the organisation side. (Advice on that is very welcome ^^)

2019 is shaping up to be a very exciting year indeed!

With our translation patch soon to be released, I thought I’d use the chance to take a little peak inside the game. Truth be told, this game is surprisingly clean, but here are a few things that did get left behind…

    {url: '/images/blog/0008/617763755953176576_1.png', alt: 'These images weren’t left over per-se, but some early screenshots from the media release information about the game. Note the UI differences!'},
    {url: '/images/blog/0008/617763755953176576_2.png', alt: 'A placeholder “title” for the start of new chapters. (In the end, the chapters were left unnamed.)'},
    {url: '/images/blog/0008/617763755953176576_3.png', alt: 'Some more “dummy” placeholders, from event BG’s to character busts and cut-in images.'},
    {url: '/images/blog/0008/617763755953176576_4.png', alt: 'An unused alert for Lord Death’s Task, and it’s proposed translation. This was supposed to appear in the top screen, which we know as this scene was still included in the original release trailer!'},

    {url: '/images/blog/0008/617763755953176576_6.png', alt: 'An unused image from the “Mission Bulletin”. It’s very similar to the actual list found in chapter 5, with the exception of “Fearsome Zombie Area?!” being replaced by “Dash to the Fountain Square!”.'},

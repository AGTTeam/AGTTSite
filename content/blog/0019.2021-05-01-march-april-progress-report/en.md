Two months have flown by like the wind, but we’re excited to be back bringing you the latest news!

## \[NDS\] Death Note: Kira Game

We’re proud to announce that work has begun on yet another project, Death Note: Kira Game for the Nintendo DS! Imagine a game of mafia (werewolf) or Among Us played by all your favorite Death Note characters and this is the game you get. Characters take turns building trust and raising suspicion until a round of voting takes place. In the role of Kira, it is your goal to remove L from the game through voting or with the power of your Death Note. As L, you must gather the trust of your fellow investigators to bring Kira to justice.

The game includes a story mode which roughly follows the events of the manga/anime, as well as single and multiplayer modes where you can play the Kira Game with computer AI’s or your friends.  

Already, translations have been completed for the tutorial and four story chapters.


## \[NDS\] Vampire Knight DS

Next is an oldie, but a goldie! Originally started in 2018 by Zorbnog, the AGT Team have officially restarted work on translating Vampire Knight for the Nintendo DS. Set in an alternative universe, the game gives players a chance to explore the prestigious Cross Academy as never seen before, and to learn more about many fan-favorite characters.

Thanks to the work left behind by the old team, the project has been off to a roaring start, with translations already having reached the fourth chapter.


## \[PS2/PSP\] Soul Eater: Battle Resonance

The majority of Battle Resonance’s text comes from its Adventure Mode, and lots of progress has been made on that front. All mission descriptions have been translated, as have all the secondary character paths. From the three main character paths, it is only Soul and Maka’s Adventure Mode path which has yet to be completed.

A fun bit of trivia for Soul Eater fans, the bloodthirsty killer, Sonson-J is briefly mentioned in Battle Resonance, making him the only minor villain from the series who shows up both in this game and Monotone Princess!


## \[Wii\] Soul Eater: Monotone Princess

Speaking of Montone Princess, we’re pleased to annouce that it has now been through a total of two proofreading passes, and is awaiting one final review before it’ll be ready for release! Unfortunately, these last two months have been busy for the members of our graphics team and so not much progress has been able to be made on the remaining untranslated images, but with the bulk of the work finished now, we are determined to make sure this patch is released in a timely manner.


## \[NDS\] Spice & Wolf: The Wind that Spans the Sea

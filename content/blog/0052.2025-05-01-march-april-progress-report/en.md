As we head into May, we're wishing the best of luck to all those entering finals season. We hope this update will provide a reminder of some things to look forward to!

## \[PS2\] Fullmetal Alchemist 3: The Girl Who Succeeds God

The first round of proofreading for FMA 3 has officially begun! As well as fixing typos and checking for bugs, there is also a fair amount of lines which need manual word wrapping or trimming down, as shown here.

## \[NDS\] Death Note: Successors to L

Following our last update, our hacker, Illidan, was able to make even more improvements to the font rendering, allowing the variable-width font to display as intended. As you can see, the letters are now more condensed, giving us some much needed extra room for the translations!

## \[NDS\] Mushishi: Amefuru Sato

As the final proofreading round of Mushishi continues to progress, we've been able to use the feedback we've received from testers to improve some instructions about the various stylus-based mechanics featured in the game.

## Other

Although things may seem a little quiet on the home front, behind the scenes we have been working on two as-of-yet unannounced projects. If things go as planned, one of them should be ready for release by the end of summer, so please keep your eyes peeled!

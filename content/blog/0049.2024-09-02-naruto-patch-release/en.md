## Naruto: Path of the Avenger / Naruto RPG 2: Chidori Vs Rasengan (ナルトRPG2 - 千鳥VS螺旋丸) patch by the Anime Game Translations Team

For what may be the last time: Hey all, Ligudink here! I would like to proudly announce that Naruto: Path of the Avenger is finally here. That's it, people, it's done. Words can't even begin to describe how overjoyed I am to actually see this through to the end considering how intensely difficult these past two years have been on me.

I advise you all to do these things when playing the game:
1) Get to Level 10 before reaching the Hidden Leaf Village. It's a very easy grind and make sure no one in your party dies since they all start out with the exact same EXP progression.
2) Make sure you know what weapons you give your support members as they COULD make a difference in a pinch.
3) Know your formations and make good use of them!
4) Pay good attention to NPC dialogue. They're far from vague, and they may help your progress the story.
5) Play the first game before this. It's 10 hours long and pretty fun at that.

With that outta the way, I want to deeply thank AGT Team's iconic duo Illidan and Phantom for giving me this opportunity in the first place and for aiding me with the hacking and proofreading respectively. A huge thanks goes for my co-translator PSXCraver who handled a very huge chunk of NPC text for me as well as covering in for me when I was on leave due to work. I cannot forget my dear proofreaders and playtesters Mirror Dirror, SpicyMemes101, and LaytonLoztew. Special thanks to LaytonLoztew for providing us with the game's guidebook, aiding in the local play hack, and making the dedicated [RetroAchievements pack](https://retroachievements.org/game/15481) for those who love a collectathon.

My biggest thanks however will go to my cool people at the AGT Server whom I had the pleasure to chat with, befriend, and chill around with. They always joked around with "RPG2 when" and I always pulled a Miyamoto on them. Thank you all for your patience and for believing in me.

With this game finally released, it is not known what the next step for me will be, but I will look forward to every other project that AGT has going on forward, and I hope you guys do the same. If you're a translator in need of a team to help you work on the project you've always dreamt of working on, just [shoot the server a message](https://discord.com/invite/xtVzrEk), you're always welcome. If you're a hacker, connect with fellow hackers and form a bond with translators. If you're an anime fan who wants to follow up on these games and knowledgeable in the source material, we are always in need of proofreaders/playtesters to make sure our game runs smoothly and our script is well localized!

With that I bid you all adieu.

Into the dreams of tomorrow, let's fly away!<br />

What’s this, an update outside of our regular bimontly posts!?

Since we’ve had a few asks about it, we thought you might be interested in this in-depth [Kira Game twitter update thread](https://twitter.com/HaribeauHonyaku/status/1464657182721556486) by the game’s translator & project lead, Haribeau!

If instead you are waiting expectantly for news about Vampire Knight, we’re excited to say there should be some good news coming very soon! (And as for the Soul Eater fans, unfortunately Battle Resonance has taken a bit of a backseat with these two projects reaching their ends, but it shouldn’t be too long before it’s following in their (digital) footsteps.)

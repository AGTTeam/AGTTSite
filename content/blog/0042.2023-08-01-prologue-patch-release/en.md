## L - the ProLogue to Death Note: Spiraling Trap (-螺旋の罠-) patch by the Anime Game Translations Team

The last of three Death Note games for the Nintendo DS, Spiraling Trap features an original story set before the events of the main series.

Team up with the world’s greatest detective, L, to solve traps and puzzles while attempting to uncover the truth and take a step closer to one of six possible endings. Or, take a break from the action and kick back in the optional L Communicator Mode, where you can chat with L in real-time and bond over snacks.

It’s only your life on the line…

## Bakemonogatari Portable (化物語ポータブル) patch by the Anime Game Translations Team

Welcome to a game so NISIOISIN it invented its own genre. It’s up to you to talk your way out of this “crazy mad delusional drama”.

Stand your ground in dialogue battles which impressively capture the unique feel of the anime. Relive the first season in story mode, or pick your favorite characters to go head-to-head in freeplay battles. 

A new monstory awaits…

All the way back in 2020, we posted a [progress report](/blog/2020-05-01-march-april-progress-report) that announced the launch of the Anime Game Translations team as it exists today. In that report, we hinted at some of the team's future goals; translating the Kira Game, Spice & Wolf, and Mushishi: Amefuru Sato. And now, 5 years later, with the release of the [Mushishi patch](/mushishi) last month, those goals have finally been achieved!

Of course, we aren't stopping there, so keep reading to get the latest updates on our current projects!

## \[NDS\] Death Note: Successors to L

We're thrilled to welcome a new translator to the team, nyxqueenofshadows, who has been doing an incredible job tackling the remaining untranslated lines. Thanks to their hard work, the translation is now a whopping 90% complete!

We still have a few bugs to iron out, which means that there may be a delay before we're able to start playtesting the game in earnest, but please rest assured that we have our best detective on the case!

## \[PS2\] Fullmetal Alchemist 3: The Girl Who Succeeds God

On the topic of new members, we have also been fortunate enough to be joined by KahnerC, who has gone above and beyond their duties as a proofreader on FMA 3. They've not only helped to fix typos and overly long lines, but have also flagged issues with some of the game's textures and researched other media tied to the game.

We are now onto the second proofreading pass, in which we hope to fix the bugs and issues that were discovered during the first round.

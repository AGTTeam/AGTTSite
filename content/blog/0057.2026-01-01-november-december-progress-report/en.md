And just like that, another year has been and gone! We wish everyone a very Happy New Year from all of us here at the team.

In the spirit of new starts, this post is going to be a bit different as we're looking forwards at the work which still needs to be done to show you a snippet of what goes on behind the scenes!

## \[NDS\] Death Note: Successors to L

As mentioned in our last post, we've not officially opened proofreading slots as we want to solve some remaining issues first, so we thought we'd detail some here. (NB: This is not an exhaustive list.)

This is not a bug per-se, but did you know that due to the lack of canon character colours at the time, some character sprites in the game don't match their anime counterparts? This is something we want to change, and Leggy our fantastic graphic artist has already made new sprites for, although inserting the new colour palettes isn't a straightforward task.

These next two issues both involve character names. In the left screenshot, the character nametag isn't centered correctly, which is an issue that's occurred in several other games we've translated. In the right screenshot, some junk letters are printed at the start of the line.

And since it wouldn't be fair just to talk about what's left without acknowledging how far we've come, here's two screenshots of now-solved issues!

## \[PS2\] Fullmetal Alchemist 3: The Girl Who Succeeds God

FMA3 has now been through two proofreading passes, and is awaiting its final pass once all the known bugs have been fixed!

The most serious remaining bug is that the game crashes during the credits. We've had similar issues with other games before, largely because the names are much longer when spelled out in the Roman alphabet than in kanji (e.g. "荒川 弘" vs "Hiromu Arakawa".) Of course, making sure all of the text aligns correctly is on our list too.

There are also a handful of images left to edit. The image format in this game is quite different to the others we've worked on, but thanks to a tool made by our hacker, Illidan, it is possible to visualise how they work.

Lastly for this list, proofreader KahnerC is looking for help from a Japanese translator for a personal FMA-related project. We won't go too much into the details here, but those interested can find out more by joining our [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/UUF7Zbm)!

If you haven't already heard, our friends over at the Haroohie Translation Club have just released a complete translation patch for [The Series of Haruhi Suzumiya](https://haroohie.club/blog/2026-01-01-chokuretsu-full-en-release) on NDS! This was a mammoth project which has been years in the making, so make sure to check it out!

And if you've made it all the way to the end of this equally mammoth post, thanks for reading!

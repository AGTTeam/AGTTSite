## I Will Protect You (俺がオマエを守る) Patch by Phantom & Illidan 

Ore ga Omae o Mamoru is a metroidvania published by Otomate Forte, a sister brand to Otomate, focused primarily on making non-visual novel otome games (games targeted at girls).

The story focuses on the protagonist, Ren, an elite knight sent to explore recently-discovered ruins dated back to the ancient civilisation of Edenbar, known for its incredible alchemical technology, and mysterious disappearance.

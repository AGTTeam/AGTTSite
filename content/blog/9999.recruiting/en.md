Here at the AGT Team, every pair of hands counts! Whether you're looking to develop your skills, or help a project you love come to fruition, we'd be delighted to hear from you.

Keep reading below to find out what roles are currently recruiting, and register your interest with either Phantom or Illidan on our [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/UUF7Zbm)!

### Roles
All of our projects have different demands, but these are the roles we most commonly look for;

**Translators:** Translate text and images from Japanese to English. Must have a good understanding of both languages (i.e. not relying on a machine translator). 

**Graphics Editors:** Edit the game's graphics into English using the provided translations. Must be confident using graphics software such as Photoshop or GIMP.

**Proofreaders:** Play the game once the translation is complete, and look out for any bugs, typos, or untranslated text. You should be prepared to commit the time to play the game all the way through at least once, and possibly multiple times. Japanese language skills are not required.

### Future Translations
We're currently looking for a lead translator for the following:
* **\[NDS\] Kimi no Yusha**
* **\[PSP\] Nendoroid Generation**

Or, if you are a Japanese translator looking to start a project but need some support, please message us to discuss!

### Current Projects
If you're interested in proofreading a project which is still being translated, you're welcome to message us and register your interest. We will then contact you once proofreading begins.

* **\[NDS\] Naruto RPG 2: Chidori Vs Rasengan:** End stages, no longer recruiting.
* **\[NDS\] Mushishi: Amefuru Sato:** Proofreaders wanted, please message Phantom, Illidan or Ithyrial!
* **\[NDS\] Death Note: Successors to L:** Applications for proofreading are welcome.
* **\[PS2\] Fullmetal Alchemist 3: The Girl Who Succeeds God:** Applications for proofreading are welcome.

We’re back with another project roundup, and this time, we are happy to announce three new projects being undertaken by the Anime Game Translations team!

## [WonderSwan] Neon Genesis Evangelion - Shito Ikusei

First is a release for the WonderSwan from 1999, Neon Genesis Evangelion: Shito Ikusei. The game has you play as Ryoji Kaji. Tasked with raising the Adam embryo that he recovered for NERV, Kaji must keep a close eye on the Angel while continuing his secret investigations of the NERV headquarters. The game features Tamagotchi-esque pet simulation with a world to explore and NPCs to talk with.

Due to the nature of the game, the text was overall fairly short, and already we can announce that the game has been fully translated and is in the final stages of proofreading and playtesting!


## [PS2/PSP] Soul Eater: Battle Resonance

The second of our new projects to be announced is Soul Eater: Battle Resonance for the PS2 and PSP. This is a fairly traditional 2D fighting game featuring thirteen playable characters from the Soul Eater universe. The game’s Adventure Mode closely follows the story of the anime with minor changes depending on which of the three primary teams the player chooses to fight with.

The differences between the PS2 and PSP versions are minimal, so the team has decided to do the extra work necessary to bring them both to the English-speaking world. That being said, this project is still in its early stages. Translations have begun, but the bulk of the text is still waiting to be taken on.  


## [NDS] Spice & Wolf: The Wind that Spans the Sea

Thirdly, with the release of the patch for the first game, work has begun on the second Spice & Wolf game for the NDS - Umi o Wataru Kaze! Building on and improving the gameplay from the first game, this installment sees the introduction of a second travelling companion, allowing players to choose between deepening their relationship with Holo or another heroine of their choice.

Like Battle Resonance, the project is still in it’s early stages, but while work continues on getting the tool up to speed, we’re currently recruiting translators! It’s not a direct sequel so having played My Year with Holo is not a requirement, and we’d be very grateful for any time you could spare. Interested parties, please [get in touch to find out more](https://discord.com/invite/UUF7Zbm)!


## [Wii] Soul Eater: Monotone Princess

And last but not least, following on from our last update, Monotone Princess has now reached 100% translation! Proofreading is still ongoing, but we’ve been able to make a significant amount of progress in a short time, including contracting the font and centering the originally left-offset cutscene subtitles to allow for more space (pictured) as well as finalising many of the images.

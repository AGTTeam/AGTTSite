## Spice and Wolf: The Wind that Spans the Sea (狼と香辛料 海を渡る風) patch by the Anime Game Translations Team

Part business simulator, part dating game, get ready to step into the shoes of Kraft Lawrence as you strive to take Holo back to her hometown of Yoitsu.   

Having secured a contract to collect some money from a town on the other shore, everything should be plain sailing ahead for the duo, but of course, the best laid plans of mice and wolves often go awry…

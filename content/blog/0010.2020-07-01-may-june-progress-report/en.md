And we’re back with another project round-up! This time, I’m excited to be bringing not just my projects, but updates from all of the AGT Team. Let’s jump right in!  

## \[NDS\] Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann

Gurren’s proofreading has taken a bit of a hit recently, but in the meantime we’ve still been making little updates to improve the patch, thanks to having the insight and new ideas from fresh pairs of eyes, as seen above! In the original Japanese layout, the battle result text was split into two halves, which works fine in kanji, but not so much English. However with a little trial and error, Illidan was able to edit the animation and bring it together.


## \[NDS\] Spice & Wolf: My One Year with Holo

I covered this game more in my [last post](https://agtteam.tumblr.com/post/621299815450591232/i-am-a-big-fan-of-spice-and-wolf-and-notice-some), but whilst we’re on the topic of improvement hacks, check out the subtitles on the upper-right, which are newly added to allow us to use text in scenes that didn’t previously have, such as translating the lyrics to the opening movie!


## \[NDS\] Vampire Knight DS

And following the trend of going behind the scenes, allow me to share this little snippet from the Vampire Knight Google Drive, which Dariya has colour-coded so beautifully! From here on I’ll be leaving future updates about this project to them, which you can get by visiting the [GBAtemp forum thread](https://gbatemp.net/threads/vampire-knight-ds-game-translation.527480/) or joining the [VK Discord server](https://discord.gg/V28Dpx7)!


## \[Wii\] Soul Eater: Monotone Princess

Operation Resonance have been working tirelessly, and recently hit the incredible milestone of having dialogue translation reach 20%! There’s also been a lot of interesting discussion about interpreting game-only names and terms, in the wake of finalising name-tag images.

With Ore Ga still on hold, that’s all from me for now, but if you’re a fan of anime gaming or looking to help out, feel free to join in the fun at the [AGT Discord](https://discord.com/invite/UUF7Zbm) and help us answer the question; what is the best anime-based game of all time?

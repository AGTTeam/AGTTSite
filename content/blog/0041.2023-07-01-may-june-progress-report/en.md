A new month is here, and you know what that means… Time for a quick project round-up!

## \[NDS\] Mushishi: Amefuru Sato

Hey! Ithyrial here, back with another update for the Mushishi: Amefuru Sato translation!

A fair amount of progress has been made since the last update! All system notifications (like messages shown when catching mushi or picking up items) have been translated, as well as most of the menu text. Certain UI elements (e.g. anything image-based, such as the in-game map or the titles for menu screens) have yet to be translated, and there’s still a lot of work to be done regarding character dialogue as well, but rest assured that it IS being worked on! 

And if anybody would like to help, don’t be shy! Please [feel free to reach out](https://discord.com/invite/UUF7Zbm)! 

That’s all for now. See ya next update!

Hello, Phantom here! …And this is the face I make when I come across another baseball reference that needs checking. Fortunately, I’m pleased to say that the first proofreading pass is now (virtually) complete! Other than further proofreading, there are still a few minor bugs which we’re trying to stamp out, but the finish line is finally in sight!


## \[NDS\] Naruto RPG 2: Chidori Vs Rasengan

Ligudink here!

I suspended my other works for this project, so y'all better be thankful!!! I am now working through the heaps of NPC text scattered around the world of this game. One section of this game will cater to my fellow Real Housewives of Konoha fans as it’s chock full of callbacks to them. I look forward to y'all finding them hehehehehehe.

I thank you all for your continued anticipation towards this passion project.

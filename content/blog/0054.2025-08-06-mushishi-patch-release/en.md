## Mushishi: Amefuru Sato (蟲師 〜天降る里〜) patch by the Anime Game Translations Team

Based on the Mushishi anime/manga series, the game follows a young Mushishi apprentice as they go about their daily life in a rural village, with quaint activities such as fishing, gathering, helping the villagers with their problems, and...catching and documenting strange, ethereal creatures known as "mushi"? Yeah, that's primarily what being a "Mushishi" entails, as well as curing ailments brought on by the little critters.

(I guess you could sort of compare it to Animal Crossing, but without all the talking animals...)

Featuring a lush, beautifully hand-drawn environment, peaceful ambience and soundtrack, and guest appearances by characters from the original series, the game plays out much like an episode of the anime itself, without needing any prior familiarity to be able to enjoy the game and its story!

But don't just sit here and listen to me yap, go check it out for yourself!

## Soul Eater: Battle Resonance (ソウルイーター バトルレゾナンス) Patch by the Anime Game Translations Team

Take control of 13 playable characters in this traditional 2.5D fighting game for the PS2 and PSP featuring recognizable attacks and stylish resonance arts.

In addition to an adventure mode which follows the original story, there are versus, team battle, and arcade modes for you to continue the battle long after the 51-mission story has ended.

*   [Download the Patch](/resonance)
*   [Game Trailer](https://youtu.be/cYAvcnGk5ZY)

Play the version of your choice - unique to the PS2 version is the Soul Theater, an additional mode for viewing screenshots from the anime, as well as additional costumes for Maka, Black☆Star and Kid. Or take advantage of the PSP’s Ad Hoc mode to take on your friends in multiplayer with your own dedicated battle camera.

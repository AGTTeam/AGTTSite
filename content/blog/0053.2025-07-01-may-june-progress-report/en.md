You know the drill, so let's jump right in!

## \[NDS\] Death Note: Successors to L

We're delighted to have been joined by new graphics editor Leggy (who's actually rather handy), and has made great progress not only on converting images with text, but also recoloring certain character sprites to make them match with their anime counterparts. The lack of space in some images has also challenged us to get creative with both translation and technical tweaks to ensure that the images are legible while still looking good.

## \[PS2\] Fullmetal Alchemist 3: The Girl Who Succeeds God

We've tackled a good majority of the known bugs for FMA 3, and are now looking for a dedicated proofreader to assist with the first proofreading pass. Being the first pass, there will be a greater number of issues such as typos/lines that are too long, so we are ideally looking for someone who is native or very confident in their English, has an eye for detail, and most importantly has the time and passion to commit to the project. If this sounds like you, please contact Phantom or Illidan at the [AGT Team Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/UUF7Zbm), where we can discuss further!

## \[NDS\] Mushishi: Amefuru Sato

We know we've kept you waiting, Mushishi fans! However, we can now officially announce that we've set a target release date for the end of summer, (or winter for our friends in the southern hemisphere), so please keep your eyes peeled!

## Other

![Shito Ikusei screenshot](/images/blog/0053/04_other.png)

Thanks to a report, we learned of a bug in the base game of Neon Genesis Evangelion: Shito Ikusei (Angel Raising Project) which prevented the event completion rate from rising above 99%. We have since updated the patch to fix this, which you can grab [here](/shito)!

The bug in question relates to an event where Kaji looks at a photograph in Misato's apartment that can only be triggered once, so if you have already seen the event you will need to reset your save data in order to be able to reach 100% completion. Round of applause, anyone?

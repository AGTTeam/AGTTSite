Halloween may be over, but we're back with some updates that are sure to thrill! 

## \[NDS\] Death Note: Successors to L

This is not a drill... Successors to L has now reached 100% translation thanks to nyxqueenofshadows! The image editing work is now also complete. We still have a few more bugs to solve, but we hope to open up the project to proofreaders in the coming months!

## \[PS2\] Fullmetal Alchemist 3: The Girl Who Succeeds God

Progress has been equally spine tingling over on FMA3, as SONICMAN69 (who you may recognize as the translator of the recent [Cowboy Bebop PS2 English patch](https://github.com/SONICMAN69/Bebop-PS2-English)), has joined to take charge of the second proofreading pass. Armed with their passion for the series, and KahnerC's sharp eye, the game's script has taken on a new life.

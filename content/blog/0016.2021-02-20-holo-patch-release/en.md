## Spice and Wolf: My Year With Holo (狼と香辛料 ボクとホロの一年) patch by the Anime Game Translations Team

Life can be tough for a novice merchant, but when an offer too good to refuse finds its way into your lap, what’s a peddler to do?

A non-linear story with 12 possible endings, it’s time to take the reins and explore the charms of a pseudo-Medieval world, with Wisewolf Holo as your travel guide!

**Looking for more?**
Did you know this game had a spiritual successor called The Wind that Spans the Sea? While the story is unrelated, the second DS game expands on many of the mechanics, even adding the possibility of a new second companion.

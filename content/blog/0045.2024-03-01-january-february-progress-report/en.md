And just like that, March is here! How has the new year been treating you? Here’s how we’ve been getting on…

Hello there everybody! Things are going well with the extensive proofreading going on with the scripts of the game! The painfully long list of Onsen interactions are now \[almost\] complete! It’s in the polishing phase and I’m looking forward to reaching the day where I write the update detailing the release! Take care, people!!


## \[NDS\] Mushishi: Amefuru Sato

Progress on the dialogue translations is slowly but surely being made, with the overall completion now at 59%!

As different mushi become active at different times of year, we’re just in the midst of whipping up a new batch of Mushi Repellent to help us stave off any work-eating mushi, but we need some more help.

If you, or someone you know, might have some time to spare to help out with translating or proofreading, please consider [getting in touch](https://href.li/?https://discord.com/invite/UUF7Zbm)!

We are currently looking for translators for:

**[NDS] Mushishi: Amefuru Sato** (Assistant Translator)  
**[NDS] Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch** (Assistant Translator)  
**[NDS] Death Note: Successors to L** (Lead Translator)

## Death Note: Kira Game (デスノート: キラゲーム) patch by the Anime Game Translations Team

The first of three Death Note games for the Nintendo DS, the Kira Game sees the Kira Task Force investigators play a new game that’s all the rage in an attempt to better understand Kira’s thought process and mentality.

Calculate your way through 11 story chapters, and be sure to stock up on those apples to unlock all 19 playable characters, as well as the alternative bonus chapter.

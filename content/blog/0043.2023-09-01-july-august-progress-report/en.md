As the summer draws to a close, let’s take a look back at what we’ve been up to…

## \[NDS\] Naruto RPG 2: Chidori Vs Rasengan

Hi, it’s Phantom here! Were you expecting someone else? Well, we’re excited to say that Ligudink, Naruto RPG2 project leader and update-writer until now, has started work as a professional translator!

Despite his busy schedule, we’re pleased that he will be staying on as a proofreader, so you can be sure that the text style will remain consistent throughout. However, this does mean that we’re now short of a translator and are looking to recruit someone to finish off the rest of the text!

Both the menus and storyline have been translated, adding up to roughly 73% completion, with only the NPC dialogue and hot springs conversations to go. If think you might be able to lend a hand and help us cross the finish line, please get in touch with myself or Ligudink over at our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/UUF7Zbm)!


## \[NDS\] Mushishi: Amefuru Sato

Ithyrial here! I’m sorry to admit that progress has been slow, so there isn’t much to update on, unfortunately.

But that doesn’t mean we didn’t get ANYTHING done, of course. With the help of Phantom’s image-editing skills, all of the Japanese text found on certain visual elements (map, mushi list, etc.) has been translated! Yay!

All that’s left by this point is the dialogue and some story text. I’m gonna try to adjust my approach so that I can get more work done and there will be more to report on in the next update!

As always, feel free to contact us if you’d like to help out!


## Other

If you’ve been following us for a while now, you might have heard that we’ve been making updates to our old translation tools to make them more accessible. After a lot of extra hours put in by our hacker, we’re pleased to announce that this process is finally finished. All of our tools now feature a snazzy UI, and, with the exception of the Spice & Wolf and Gurren Lagann tools, are fully cross-platform!

If you’ve been using an older version of a tool, make sure to update by grabbing the latest release on its respective [Github page](https://github.com/orgs/AGTTeam/repositories). All of the updates have been tested and should be working, but if you do run into any problems, please open an issue on Github or drop us a line and we’ll be happy to help.

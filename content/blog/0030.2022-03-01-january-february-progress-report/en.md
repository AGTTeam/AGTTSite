With one patch already released this year (psst, it’s [here](/blog/2022-02-16-kiragame-patch-release)), you could say, we’ve started as we mean to go on!

## [PS2/PSP] Soul Eater: Battle Resonance

…Which brings us neatly to Battle Resonance. Work on this patch began way back in January 2020, although it wasn’t officially picked up by a translator until the following year, either way you count it, it’s been a long time! Fortunately, that wait is nearly over. While we don’t have an idea of a date yet, you can expect it to be out before our next progress report in May. 


## [NDS] Spice & Wolf: The Wind that Spans the Sea

In other exciting news, Spice & Wolf has now reached 100% translation! It has since moved into the proofreading phase, and good progress has already been made on the first pass.


## [PSP] Bakemonogatari Portable

We introduced the project in our last update, but let’s talk a little about the game. In Bakemonogatari Portable, your words are your weapons as you face off against opponents in dialogue battles. There are 5 story arcs based on the original series, as well as a host of extras including a Delusion Mode where you can create your own unique conversations.

The translation work has entered its early stages, although further improvements are still being made to the tool to address some issues which have cropped up.


## Other projects

Lastly, for our eagle-eyed followers, you may have noticed the addition of  Naruto RPG 2 and Kimi no Yusha into our projects list. Both were only started recently so we don’t have any exciting screenshots to share just yet, but they have not been forgotten! 

And of course, for those eagerly awaiting news about Death Note, we have set up the foundation work for both the second and third DS games now, although nothing has started on either yet as we don’t have any translators free. (If you’re a translator and think you could help with that, please [get in touch](https://discord.com/invite/UUF7Zbm)!)

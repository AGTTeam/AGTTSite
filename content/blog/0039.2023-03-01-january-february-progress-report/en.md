Spring is finally on its way, bringing with it new beginnings (and hopefully some endings!)

## \[NDS\] Naruto RPG 2: Chidori Vs Rasengan

Hey there everybody! Hope y'all had a great start to this year, so allow me to end the first trimester of this year with updating you all on the progress of the project!

Translation moved towards completing the menus as RPGs have a lot of those ya know! A small chunk of NPC text was done (mostly necessary for progressing through the story like in the Tsunade Search Half of the game). I will apologize on that end due to my increasing stress as a college senior.

The shortcomings of the translation part of the update was made up for with the romhacking front of the project thanks to our one and only Illidan! The menus specifically were redone with the updated font (unlike POTN1’s messy looking font) as well as squishing bugs I had originally encountered when testing it myself. I hope you may all see the end of the path the ninja has walked (WAIT NO DON’T READ THE MANGA!)  


## \[NDS\] L - the ProLogue to Death Note: Spiraling Trap

The wave of bug fixes also hit L - the ProLogue to Death Note and the major issues have now been fixed! Proofreading has finally begun, with the first pass currently having reached the halfway point. We also stumbled on the debug menu, pictured above. 

The debug menu contains three screens which allow you to jump between events in the game, as well as view some unused content. All of the relevant text has now been translated, and a cheat code to access the menu will be included with the patch.


## Other

We mentioned new beginnings at the start of this post, but those eagle-eyed readers might have noticed that one of our longest standing projects, Mushishi: Amefuru Sato, is now in translation! It’s too soon to say too much about it now, but we hope to bring you more news next time.

Meanwhile, there have also been several innovations going on behind the scenes. We’re currently trialing Weblate as our main hub for future translation projects, and several of our [hacking tools](https://github.com/orgs/AGTTeam/repositories) have been given a fresh lick of paint to make them fully compatible with Linux and Mac.

If you’re curious about retranslating one of our past projects to another language or helping with a new one, please do [get in touch](https://discord.com/invite/xtVzrEk)! We’re still looking for translators for Death Note: Successors to L, Nendoroid Generation and Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch.

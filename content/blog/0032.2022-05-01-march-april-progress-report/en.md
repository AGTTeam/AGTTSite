Weâ€™re proud to be able to say that with the release of theÂ [Battle Resonance patch](https://agtteam.tumblr.com/post/681343377005068288/soul-eater-battle-resonance-english-patch) in April, all three Japan-only Soul Eater console games are now available in English (and thereâ€™s even one in [Spanish](http://www.romhacking.net/translations/6149/)!) Who knows, maybe itâ€™ll be your favorite series getting the same treatment next? ðŸ˜‰

So without any further ado, letâ€™s jump straight in to what the teamâ€™s been up to lately. (Warning: this is going to be a long one!)  

## [PSP] Bakemonogatari Portable

BakemonogatariÂ Portable is now 100% translated! This includes all the cutscene subtitles and signs which have been reinserted into the game, as shown above. Proofreading is also well underway, so itâ€™ll be a toss up between this and Spice & Wolf as to what our next release will be.  


## [NDS] Spice & Wolf: The Wind that Spans the Sea

On that note, the first proofreading pass for Spice & Wolf has now been completed. Whatâ€™s more, our proofreading team has doubled in size since the last update, helping to put the wind in our sails.

Weâ€™re also currently working on a fix for a rare bug which prevents the player from being able to complete a contract, present in the original game.


## [NDS] Kimi no Yusha

As we briefly announced last time, we are actively working on Kimi no Yusha, a Nintendo DS JRPG designed to be easily digestible in short, bite-sized play sessions. Due to the gameâ€™s story-driven nature, there is a large amount of text to go through. We are, though, happy to say that the first two chapters of 25 have already been translated. We hope you look forward to seeing more of it in future updates.  


## [NDS] L - the ProLogue to Death Note: Spiraling Trap

![L - the ProLogue to Death Note: Spiraling Trap screenshot](/images/blog/0032/683038801626644480_3.png)

Hot on the heels of [Death Note: Kira Gameâ€™s release](https://agtteam.tumblr.com/post/676282663687028736/death-note-kira-game-english-patch-released) in February of this year, work has already begun on the next game in the series, L - The ProLogue to Death Note: Spiraling Trap. The game takes place before the events of the manga and features the player character as they are caught in a web of mystery that they must escape. Weâ€™ve only just begun the translation and still have a long way to go, but we hope to see its completion before the whole project spirals out of control.  

(If you were instead hoping for news about the second Death Note DS game, Successors to L, donâ€™t despair. We prioritized the third game as it has an original story, whereas Successors to L is a retelling of the manga like the Kira Game, but it is on our to-do list!)


## [NDS] Naruto RPG 2: Chidori Vs Rasengan

As the translation for Naruto RPG 2 progresses, weâ€™ve been working on implementing variable-width and lowercase English letters into the font, which previously only supported all caps. As you can see, thereâ€™s still some work for the graphics team to do to improve the look of the letters, and (hopefully!) make it look even better than the font used in the official English releases from the series.Â Â

And thatâ€™s everything from this update. Phew! You might need to excuse us while we catch our breath.

As promised, it’s time for another project round-up post! Let’s start with the most progress…  

## [NDS] Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann

Gurren is pretty much done for my part! It’s currently being proofread/playtested by TheSeventhCrusader, who is providing a much needed fresh pairs of eyes to make sure everything is up to scratch. Please look forward to it!


## [NDS] Soul Eater: Medusa’s Plot

I’ve mentioned this game in a previous ask but haven’t had the pleasure of officially announcing it in an post until now! Also known as “Medusa’s Conspiracy” or “Plot of Medusa”, this game follows the first half of the Soul Eater anime. Having been fully translated by the amazing EnvyPlays, I’m looking forward to providing some of the quality checking and getting this patch out to you in the nearish future!


## [NDS] Vampire Knight DS

I won’t speak too much about this one having already made a post about it recently, but the short version is that Dariya is back in the lead, and looking for help from both translators and non-Japanese speakers to deal with the challenge of organizing this script! If you have the time to spare, please do consider getting in touch with one of us down at the [VK discord server!](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2FV28Dpx7&t=NDBkOGU5MWQ4OTY0MzNmNzE3NDNhYzJiMjc0OGY3ODA2ZTY4ODE5ZSw0OThhMThiZTlhZmJhMzg0OGI5ZmZmNjNjMmYzNDYzZDllNzZkOWUy)


## [NDS] Ore ga Omae wo Mamoru (Non-Anime)

This game is still on pause as I’ve been focused on the above, but I am thrilled that Illidan has been able to lend a hand with the technical side (which was seemingly impossible at first), in order to iron out some issues and improve the overall performance! With exams on the way this month and some very exciting new developments, it will likely be a while yet until I’m able to return to this project, but it looks to be even better than I’d hoped.


## [NDS] Spice & Wolf: My One Year with Holo
![Spice & Wolf: My One Year with Holo screenshot](/images/blog/0007/616906319666020352_4.png)

Speaking of new developments, we have the official launch of the revival project for the first Spice & Wolf game; Boku to Holo no Ichinen! Continuing from the translations left behind by Suruz and his team, this has been a long-awaited project! The lead work on this is not myself but three new translators who have delightfully joined us, which brings me to mention…


## The Anime Game Translations Team!

Hosted by myself and the ever-talented Illidan, we run a small private discord server for anime related translations. It’s host to some amazing projects like [Operation Resonances’ translation of Soul Eater: Monotone Princess,](https://phantom-patches.tumblr.com/post/611826793374154752) and we’re always on the lookout for new members. Whether you’re a Japanese translator, confident proof-reader or just have a lot of time on your hands and want to get involved with one of our current works/bring forward your own, don’t hesitate
